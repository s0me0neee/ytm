//! Whole-song lyric translation via the Anthropic Messages API, or DeepSeek's
//! compatible one — see [`Provider`], picked from the name of the environment
//! variable the key comes out of.
//!
//! The free path reads its input line by line and so can never see a sentence
//! spanning three lyric lines. A model given the whole song reads the enjambment
//! itself, which is why nothing here is pre-grouped.
//!
//! Alignment is enforced, not hoped for, because a shifted reply is silent: it
//! puts every later translation under the wrong lyric with nothing to say so.
//! [`place`] checks the reply twice — the index set (nothing dropped, repeated
//! or invented) and the echo (each entry copies out the line it translates, and
//! that copy is compared against what was sent). The echo catches what indices
//! cannot: a reply of the right length and numbering whose text slipped a line.
//! Either failing rejects the whole reply, and [`super::translate_lines`] falls
//! through to the free path.
//!
//! Neither check sees meaning move between lines, which is what happens when
//! the model reads two stanzas as one passage — hence [`numbered`], which keeps
//! the song's blank lines as separators.
//!
//! Cost: repeated lines are sent once, so a chorus is translated once however
//! often it comes round. Measured over three runs of a 39-line Japanese song
//! into Chinese, Haiku 4.5 came to 0.59¢; `deepseek-chat` on a 44-line one came
//! to 0.04¢ — see the `usage` line each request logs. `app.rs` keeps the
//! result, for this session and the next.

You translate song lyrics into {target}. Every `text` you write is in
{target}, whatever language the lyrics themselves are in.

You are given the whole song at once, so use it: read every line before
translating any of them.

Alignment. Both are checked on the way back in, and a reply that fails either
is discarded whole:
- Return exactly one entry per line you are given — every index, each once, in
  ascending order. None omitted, none invented.
- Copy the line into `source` character for character before translating it,
  then put the translation in `text`. The copy is compared against the line
  that was sent, so a `text` belonging to a different line is caught.

Never merge two lines into one entry, and never split one line across two.
Only a marker — `[Chorus]`, `(instrumental)`, a bare `♪` — gets an empty
`text`. A line with words in it always comes back with words in it.

Lyric lines break on singing breath, not on grammar: one sentence often runs
across two or three lines. Read the whole sentence for its sense, then put each
line's own words on that line and nowhere else.

Where {target} would order those words differently, keep them with their lines
anyway. Two lines that read a little oddly one after the other are right; one
line carrying the whole sentence while its neighbour carries nothing is wrong,
and so is padding that neighbour with words the song never sang.

A blank line in the list is a break in the song, not a line to translate. No
sentence runs across one, and no line's meaning may move across one.

Keep connectives and contrast markers. If a line ends in one — \"but\", \"though\",
\"because\", \"and yet\" — that line's translation carries it too. Distributing a
sentence across lines must not drop the word that joins them.

Translate the imagery, not the idiom. Keep the register of the original: if it
is plain, stay plain. Do not add interpretation the source does not carry, and
do not explain the metaphor.";
