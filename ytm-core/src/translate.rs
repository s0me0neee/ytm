//! Lyric translation. Two backends, chosen by [`Backend`].
//!
//! `lyrics.ai-translation = true` sends the whole song to Anthropic or DeepSeek
//! (whichever the configured key belongs to) in one request — see [`llm`].
//! Everything else in this file is the free path, which is what
//! runs by default and is described below; the AI path falls back to it on any
//! failure, so the feature never disappears, only its quality changes.
//!
//! ── the free path ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//!
//! [`rust_translate`] is the transport; this module is the policy, the same
//! split as [`lrclib`](lrclib) and [`crate::lyrics`]. The crate is a thin
//! wrapper over Google's public `translate_a/single` endpoint and has two
//! sharp edges that everything here exists to work around:
//!
//! 1. **It interpolates the text straight into the URL.** A lyric containing
//!    `&`, `#` or `%` silently truncates or corrupts the request — `"Rock &
//!    roll #1"` comes back as `"岩石"`, just the first word. Fixed by
//!    [`percent_encode`], which `Url::parse` then leaves alone.
//! 2. **It returns only the first *segment* of the reply.** The endpoint splits
//!    its answer at sentence boundaries and the crate reads `[0][0][0]`, so
//!    anything past the first full stop is dropped without a word. Whether that
//!    bites depends on the *source* language: Japanese comes back as one
//!    segment even for a whole song, English arrives one sentence per segment.
//!
//! So a request is only trusted when the reply can be *proved* complete — one
//! line back for every line sent. [`translate_lines`] sends the first batch as
//! a probe: if it comes back whole, the rest of the song goes the same way (a
//! couple of requests, and every line translated with its neighbours for
//! context); if it doesn't, the song is re-fetched a sentence at a time, which
//! is slower but cannot silently lose half a line.
