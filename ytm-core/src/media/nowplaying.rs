//! The Now Playing centre — what macOS calls the thing MPRIS is on Linux.
//!
//! `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` is the half we publish to: what Control Centre,
//! the menu bar's Now Playing widget, the Touch Bar and a paired Watch all
//! show. `MPRemoteCommandCenter` is the half we listen on: the media keys, the
//! same widget's buttons, and the play button on a set of headphones.
//!
//! ## Being an app at all
//!
//! Neither works for a process the system does not consider an application, so
//! [`MediaControls::new`] makes this one when asked for [`Host::Console`]:
//! `NSApplication::sharedApplication` with an **accessory** activation policy,
//! which is a real app with no Dock icon, no menu bar and no window. That is
//! all AppKit is used for. Under [`Host::Windowed`] it is not used at all —
//! `gui/` is already an application, and the policy that buys a terminal its
//! registration would cost a windowed app its Dock icon and its menu bar.
//!
//! ## The run loop, without giving up the main thread
//!
//! Remote-command handlers are delivered through the *main thread's* run loop,
//! and a TUI's main thread is busy being a TUI. The usual answer is to give
//! Cocoa the main thread and move the interface onto another one — which this
//! app does not need, because its event loop already comes back here on every
//! tick: under [`Host::Console`], [`MediaControls::update`] drains the main run
//! loop with a zero timeout before it returns. A media key therefore costs at
//! most one tick of latency (200 ms, and much less while lyrics are following
//! playback), and nothing about `App::run` has to move. A windowed host is
//! already turning that loop, so `update` leaves it alone there — turning it
//! from inside a block the toolkit dispatched would re-enter our own work.
//!
//! Everything here runs on the main thread, so — unlike the other two backends
//! — there is no channel between threads and no lock. The `mpsc` is still how
//! commands travel, because the handler blocks are called *between* our own
//! stack frames and cannot be handed `&mut App`; [`super::queue`] is what wakes
//! a frontend that has no tick to notice them on.
