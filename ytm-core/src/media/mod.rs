//! The operating system's own media controls — the media keys on the keyboard,
//! and the panel the desktop shows for whatever is playing.
//!
//! Every desktop has this feature and no two of them spell it the same way, so
//! the vocabulary lives here and the wire protocol lives in a backend:
//!
//! | Target | Backend | What it talks to |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Linux | `mpris` | MPRIS2 over the session D-Bus — GNOME, KDE, `playerctl` |
//! | Windows | `smtc` | `SystemMediaTransportControls` — the volume flyout, the lock screen |
//! | macOS | `nowplaying` | `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` / `MPRemoteCommandCenter` — Control Centre |
//! | anything else | `stub` | nothing, and says so once in the log |
//!
//! One handle with three methods is all any of them expose — `new`, `update`,
//! `try_recv` — so `tui/src/app.rs` carries no `cfg` of its own and gains no
//! branch per platform. The caller builds a [`NowPlaying`] once a tick and
//! drains [`MediaCmd`]s from the same place it drains everything else; what a
//! backend cannot express (there is no volume on Windows, no quit anywhere but
//! MPRIS) simply never arrives, which costs the caller nothing.
